//! The whole simulation in one value: [`Sim`].
//!
//! A `Sim` holds the level, the tuning and every crab. It only changes when
//! you call [`Sim::tick`], and a tick always advances exactly [`STEP`]
//! seconds of game time. What the crabs do is decided only by the
//! [`Controls`] you hand it with [`Sim::set_controls`]: no clocks, no
//! randomness, no hidden state. So the same controls, tick for tick, always
//! give exactly the same result. That is what makes replays and the headless
//! tests possible.
//!
//! Who calls `tick`:
//! - the game, as many times per frame as real time needs (`src/player.rs`),
//! - the headless runner (`cargo crabsim`), as fast as the computer can,
//! - the tests, the same way.
